* Cipher-Moji
* Using emoji api that allows user to pull data from the api to get random emojis
* on load, a random set of 26 emojis will be generated and a random word will be chosen from a small array of words (I could maybe update it in the future to pull from a random word generator api)
* 26 emojis will be matched up with a letter in the alphabet
* The randomly selected word will be encrypted with the randomly generated emojis
* the 
* the player has to guess the word by figuring out what letter the emojis represents
* the player will type what word they think the encrypted word is with only one guess
* can maybe implement a way for the player to guess emoji-letter matches before guessing the full word
